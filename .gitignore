# --- Capacitor ---
www/            # Capacitor copies web assets here before sync - ALWAYS ignore
resources/      # User requested. Usually contains source icons/splash.
                # NOTE: It's often recommended to commit the *source* assets in `resources/`,
                # but ignore generated platform-specific resources *inside* android/ and ios/.
                # Ignoring the top-level resources/ folder means you need another way
                # to manage/share these source assets if collaborating.

# --- Android Platform (Capacitor) ---
# DO NOT ignore the top-level 'android/' folder itself!
# It contains necessary project configuration and source code.
